Key Points to Note

   © Springer

   The [14]LaTeX2e Proceedings Templates are available in the scientific
   authoring platform Overleaf.
   Access to your published paper

   If the conference organizers opt for 4-week free access to the volume
   on SpringerLink, then participants are able to access all papers via
   the conference website during this period (usually around the time of
   the conference).

   Conference organizers may also purchase printed books and/or USB-sticks
   containing navigable content for distribution amongst the participants.

   In addition, all authors who have included their email addresses in the
   headers of their papers will receive an email containing a coded
   personal access link, which will enable them to download the PDF of
   their paper directly from SpringerLink.”

   Springer’s policy on content sharing is given on the following page:
   [15]http://www.springer.com/gp/springernature/landing/content-sharing
   Inserting your ORCID

   Springer is the first publisher to implement the ORCID identifier for
   proceedings, ultimately providing authors with a digital identifier
   that distinguishes them from every other researcher. ORCID (Open
   Researcher and Contributor ID) hosts a registry of unique researcher
   identifiers and a transparent method of linking research activities to
   these identifiers. This is achieved through embedding ORCID identifiers
   in key workflows, such as research profile maintenance, manuscript
   submissions, grant applications and patent applications. Apply for an
   individual ORCID at [16]www.orcid.org and include it in the header of
   your paper.
   Publishing Ethics

   If figures, tables, animations or text quotations from copyrighted
   works (including websites) are included in your paper, permission must
   be obtained from the copyright holder (usually the original publisher)
   and the author(s) for both the print and the online format. “Please
   refer to the [17]Third-party permissions page for more details.”

   Self-plagiarism, duplicate submissions and “salami publishing” are not
   acceptable. “Kindly refer to the [18]Book Policies page for guidelines
   on publishing ethics, conflict-on-interest statements, and more.”

   If you wish to extend your Springer Computer Science proceedings paper
   for publication as a journal article, the following principles must be
   followed: a) the extended version has to include at least 30% new
   material; b) it has to cite the original publication and c) it must
   include an explicit statement about the increment (e.g., new results,
   better description of materials, etc.).
   License to Publish Agreement

   Each contribution must be accompanied by a Springer Nature License to
   Publish agreement. Modified agreements are not acceptable. The
   corresponding author, who is also marked as such in the header of the
   paper, must sign the agreement on behalf of all of the authors of a
   particular paper, having gained their permission to do so. He or she
   signs and accepts responsibility for releasing the material on behalf
   of any and all co-authors. The corresponding author must be available
   to check the paper before it is published. Please note that once a
   paper has been delivered to Springer, changes relating to the
   authorship of the paper cannot be made. Authors’ names cannot be added
   or deleted, their order cannot be changed, and the corresponding author
   cannot be altered .
   Information for volume editors

   If you would like to know more about the tasks of the volume editors,
   please take a look at the [19]information for editors of Springer
